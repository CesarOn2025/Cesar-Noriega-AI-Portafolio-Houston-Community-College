Project: Data Visualization for Security Analysis (ITAI 1372 Lab)

1. Problem Statement
Before building any AI model (especially in Cybersecurity), raw data must be explored to understand distribution, correlations, and anomalies. This lab focused on mastering advanced visualization techniques to uncover patterns and features critical for Machine Learning model development.

2. Approach and Methodology
This project utilized the **Seaborn** library (built on Matplotlib) to perform comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Data: Network traffic logs from a simulated security environment.
Method: Implementation of key visualization types: Pair Plots, Correlation Heatmaps, and Categorical Distribution Plots
Key Steps: Data loading and cleaning, statistical summaries, and visualization of key relationships between variables.

3. Results and Key Findings
The project successfully demonstrated the ability to interpret complex relationships within large datasets visually:

Key Finding: Visualization effectively identified clear identification of outlier data points indicative of network anomalies and high correlations between specific network features which would require specialized handling before model training.
Skill Demonstrated: Proficiency in creating publication-quality charts for technical reports and documentation.

4. Technologies Used
Libraries: Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy
Language: Python

5. How to Run
1.  Code: Notebook file: `Seaborn_Data_Analysis.ipynb`
2.  Setup: Requires Python libraries listed above.
